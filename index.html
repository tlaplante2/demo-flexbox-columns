                    <h3>Light without Dark</h3>
                    <p>Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Let that brush dance around there and play. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.</p>

                    <h3>Makes you Happy</h3>
                    <p>Don't fight it, use what happens. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Do an almighty painting with us. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains.</p>

                    <h3>Work that Paint</h3>
                    <p>Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>
